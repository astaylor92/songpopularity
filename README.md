# songpopularity
A place to work on models to understand how artist information and audio features from Spotify help predict play counts from last.fm.

# Overall

This was a project to use some data I found from Kaggle to classify beer styles based on their characteristics, primarily tasting notes. If you're curious about the project and process, check out the [page on my website](https://astaylor92.github.io/song-popularity/).

# Files

Please note that **all** data files have been removed - this just contains code. In order to appropriate work through these notebooks, you would need to clone the repo, then download a [snapshot of the musicbrainz data](https://musicbrainz.org/doc/MusicBrainz_Database/Download) before running the notebooks in order.
